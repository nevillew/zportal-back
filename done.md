# Completed Implementation Tasks

This document tracks completed implementation tasks from the `build.md` roadmap.

## 2023-04-13

### Enhanced Validation Helpers

- **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/validation.ts`
- **Task**: Enhanced validation helpers to support all required validation types from `plan.md`
- **Description**: Implemented comprehensive validation utilities including:
  - `validateEnum`: Validates against allowed enum values
  - `validateRequired`: Checks for required fields
  - `validateLength`: Validates string length constraints
  - `validateFormat`: Generic pattern-based validation
  - `validateEmail`: Email format validation
  - `validateUrl`: URL format validation
  - `validateNumber`: Numeric range validation
  - `validateDate`: Date validation with optional range constraints
  - `validateCustom`: Support for complex custom validation logic
  - `validateRequestBody`: Utility for applying multiple validation rules to a request body
- **Benefits**: These validation helpers provide a standardized way to validate incoming requests across all Edge Functions, ensuring data integrity and consistent error responses.

### Refined Companies Edge Function

- **File**: `supabase/functions/companies/index.ts`
- **Task**: Refined permission checks and improved DB error handling
- **Description**: 
  - Replaced direct user profile checks with the `has_permission` RLS helper function for permission controls
  - Added specific permission keys: 'admin:create_company' and 'admin:delete_company'
  - Implemented comprehensive database error handling for:
    - Unique constraint violations (company name must be unique) - returns 409 Conflict
    - Foreign key constraint violations during deletion - returns 409 Conflict with clear message
    - Missing records - returns 404 Not Found with appropriate messages
- **Benefits**: 
  - More consistent permission checking using the standard has_permission helper
  - Better user experience with clearer error messages
  - Improved security by ensuring proper permission checks before operations
  - More robust API with graceful handling of expected database constraint errors

### Improved Custom Field Definitions Edge Function

- **File**: `supabase/functions/custom-field-definitions/index.ts`
- **Task**: Refined permission checks and enhanced error handling
- **Description**: 
  - Replaced custom `checkStaffPermission` function with proper `has_permission` RLS helper
  - Added dedicated permission key: 'admin:manage_custom_fields'
  - Implemented comprehensive database error handling for various scenarios:
    - Unique constraint violations - returns 409 Conflict with specific details
    - Foreign key violations during deletion - returns 409 Conflict with user-friendly message
    - Check constraint violations - returns 400 Bad Request with field validation info
    - Not null violations - returns 400 Bad Request identifying the missing required field
    - Missing records - returns 404 Not Found with appropriate messages
- **Benefits**: 
  - Standardized permission model using the common RLS helper
  - Improved API resilience with better error handling
  - Enhanced user experience with clear, specific error messages
  - Graceful handling of database constraint errors for more robust operations

### Enhanced Issues Edge Function

- **File**: `supabase/functions/issues/index.ts`
- **Task**: Implemented permission checks, added validation, and improved error handling
- **Description**: 
  - Replaced direct permission checks with the `has_permission` RLS helper function
  - Added proper status and priority enum validation for both POST and PUT endpoints:
    - Status validated against: 'Open', 'Investigating', 'Resolved', 'Closed'
    - Priority validated against: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical'
  - Implemented comprehensive database error handling for all operations:
    - Foreign key violations - returns 400 Bad Request with specific information about which reference is invalid
    - Check constraint violations - returns 400 Bad Request
    - Not null violations - returns 400 Bad Request with the required field name
    - Missing records - returns 404 Not Found
    - Reference integrity violations on deletion - returns 409 Conflict
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent permission model aligned with other endpoints
  - Data integrity ensured through proper enum validation 
  - Improved error handling with specific, helpful error messages
  - More robust API with graceful handling of expected database errors
  - Better developer experience through standardized input validation

### Improved Milestones Edge Function

- **File**: `supabase/functions/milestones/index.ts`
- **Task**: Enhanced permission checks, validation, approval workflow, and error handling
- **Description**: 
  - Replaced direct permission checks with consistent `has_permission` calls for all operations:
    - Added 'milestone:manage' permission key for CRUD operations
    - Added 'milestone:approve' permission key for approval workflow
  - Added proper status enum validation for both POST and PUT methods:
    - Validated against: 'Pending', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Approved', 'Rejected'
  - Enforced approval workflow logic:
    - Verified sign_off_required flag before approval
    - Properly updated status, signed_off_by_user_id, and signed_off_at during approval
    - Prevented direct status updates to 'Completed' when sign-off is required
  - Implemented comprehensive database error handling for all operations:
    - Foreign key violations with specific information about which reference is invalid
    - Unique constraint violations for duplicate names
    - Check constraint violations for invalid field values
    - Missing records with 404 responses
    - Deletion conflicts with 409 responses for records with dependencies
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent permission model using the standardized RLS helper functions
  - More secure approval workflow that properly enforces business rules
  - Better data integrity through status validation
  - Improved user experience with specific, helpful error messages
  - Robust API with proper error handling for all expected error conditions
